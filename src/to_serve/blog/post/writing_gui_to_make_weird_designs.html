    Hello! First week already proved challenging.
    Unfortunately I fell ill which also made it more difficult
    to finish something meaningful in time, but I have some results.
</p>
    <h4> The Idea </h4>
<p>
    I really like art based around very simple concepts.
    An example of such a concept is pixel art.
    The idea of pixel art is about as simple as it gets -
    you draw with little squares.
    So, I was doodling around trying to come up with something
    similar that looks cool.

    </a>
    I came up with a modification of pixel art,
    with non-parallel lines and variable line width.
    I tried recreating it in
    inkscape, but quickly encountered multiple problems, like
    differently angled lines being at different distances from each
    other and the ends of lines looking off.
</p>
    <h4> How to GUI </h4>
<p>
    In the end I just decided to write my own program to make 
    this kind of designs. Only experience writing GUI I had 
    was using QT (C++); it was painful. I decided instead to 
    use Godot, as using a python-like language with dynamically
    typed variables seemed like a much better idea for a GUI.
</p>
<p>
    I had a few ideas I wanted to implement in my Goo-e: 
    shortcuts that the user can set/unset just by right-clicking 
    the element instead of going into settings menu and 
    searching for it there (I prototyped it but didn't yet use).
    Another idea was giving the user to ability to save
    any value as default (again, by right-clicking), for
    now I implemented it with a button next to a value.
</p>
    <h4> How do I optimize this ;-; </h4>

    </a>
    As you can see the UI is incredibly bare-bones. Main features 
    are there: you can pan, zoom, draw and erase lines on a grid.
    Changing the angle of the grid is incredibly laggy as the code
    has to update a huge amount of individual nodes (objects).
    I will probably completely rewrite the entire program at 
    some point.
</p>
    <h4> Was it worth it? </h4>
<p>
    Writing an entire program just to make this very specific 
    type of designs might seems silly, especially considering
    how I realised that this effect can be achieved just by
    applying a simple image transform on a picture made using
    a normal square grid.
</p>
<p>
    Regardless, the experience is valuable.
    I felt good programming, abusing the hell
    out of Godot's signal system and other features that make 
    my life just a little bit easier. And damn does it feel 
    good accomplishing something at the end of the week and
    posting about it here. Here is something I doodled in 
    the program: see if you can figure out what it says, 
    each letter is made out of 1 line.

    That's it for this week! Let's see what lies ahead :)
