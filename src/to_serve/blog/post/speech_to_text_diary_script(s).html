First of all, this blog post is about a somewhat specific problem. Despite
this, I think it is quite useful to most readers looking for some Linux
knowledge as the tools I used are very general. Let's start with the
explanation of
</p>
<h4>
   The problem 
</h4>
<p>
   Sometimes I have good ideas when I'm outside. Sometimes I really wanna
   preserve these ideas, but it's very inconvenient to use phone keyboards,
   especially on the move. One solution is recording my voice. But then, I
   would want to transfer those recordings to my computer for future reference.
</p>
<p>
   That's not too hard to do, but what if I also want to read the text version
   of those voice recordings?

<h4>
   The solution

<h5>
   Syncthing 
</h5>
<p>
   Syncthing is an open source cross-platform program that can sync folders
   accross multiple devices. It's perfect for this problem, as it allows for
   P2P syncing (for example from your phone to your computer).
   <br>
   It's very easy to set up aswell, you download it on both devices, open a
   browser tab on 127.0.0.1:8384 and scan the ID QR with your phones camera.
   Then share whatever is the folder that has your audio recordings.
   <br>
   Sometimes your folder might have some additional files popping up in it, you
   can configure syncthing on your desktop to ignore those.
   <br>
   If you want more robust syncing, you could also host a Syncthing instance 
   on a server. In case you don't trust the server, Syncthing also provides
   encryption.

<h5>
    Storing recoring in notes
</h5>
<p>
    I use vimwiki [a (neo)vim plugin] that makes managing markdown files in a 
    wiki-like manner extremely easy.
