Me and my friend PizzArt decided to do 15 day long art challenges.
It is definitely a great way to make yourself learn something new.
You are motivated by 2 powerful things: deadlines - 1 piece everyday,
responsibility - your friend is expecting you, so you can't skip a
day for silly reasons.

4 of the images were drawn with pen and pencil, everything else
was drawn digitally in Krita (would recommend for painting).
I used filter and concept art brush packs from
<a href="https://docs.krita.org/en/resources_page.html">Krita's website</a>.
You can download the images and project files below if you want.
As you can see, the reference photos are also included.
