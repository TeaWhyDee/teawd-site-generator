MPV is one of my favorite open source projects. It's a simple-looking 
video player with an enormous amount of features while also being 
highly extensible through the lua programming language.

<h4>
   MPV-splice Script 
</h4>
<p>
    MPV-splice is a script that allows you to use MPV as a video editor.
    You set the start and end timings for fragments, and then 
    the script cuts the video and concatenates the fragments.
</p>
<p>
   I made a fork of it to extend it's abilities.
   <ul>
       <li>
           I added an option to automatically upload
            the video (to any platform, but the default config works for Streamable).
       </li>
       <li>
           I added an option to reencode the video, making the timings frame perfect.
           By default, the script does not reencode the video, allowing for extremely 
           fast results.
       </li>
       <li>
           I fixed the editing of online videos. The script will only download the 
           selected portions of the video, which allows you to cut out fragments of even
           hours long YouTube videos for example.
       </li>
   </ul>
</p>
<p>
   Another useful script I forked is 8mb, which compresses your video to 8mb, changing
   it's FPS and resolution to appropriate values.
