I might be stating the obvious, but I don't think there is any objective value
to an art piece, except, maybe, it's historical value.
<br>
What I wanna talk about, is what makes an art pirece feel more valuable to me.
One obvious thing is the context. A lot of my favorite music and visual
artwork comes from games and movies I really like. I'd say it could be
thought of as personal historical value, it makes you remember the story and
its characters. Another thing is complexity.
</p>
<h5>
   Hiding in plain sight
</h5>
<p>
   One way to achieve complexity, is to have details or shapes that are not
   obvious on first viewing. A great example is this Hyper Light Drifter
   artwork I have as a poster. 
<a href="https://www.fangamer.com/products/hld-poster-fallen">
<img src="/resources/HLD/poster.png" id="smallimg"
alt="https://www.fangamer.com/products/hld-poster-fallen"/>
</a>
   Can you see a hand and a skull of a giant that form the rock?
   Some other details require familiarity with the game to notice. Discovering
   these was very satisfying.
</p>
<h5>
   Telling a story
</h5>
<p>
   A lot of art also tries to convey some idea or commentary. Sometimes it's
   explicit, sometimes hidden in metaphors and puzzles. I love when an artpiece
   leaves a lot to interpretation, a great example I can think of is <a
   href="https://www.youtube.com/c/vewnscape/videos">vewns animations</a>:
   surface level topics and ideas are clear, others require multiple watches
   and some thinking to understand, but still leave some ambiguity.
   Unfortunately, I'm not the best at deciphering metaphors, and even worse at
   trying to come up with a metaphor that could convey some of my feelings or
   ideas.
</p>
<h5>
   Putting secrets
</h5>
<p>
    Doesn't really add complexity in the same sense, but
   what I recently came to like to do is putting ARG-like hidden messages in
   some of the art I make. 
   It's mostly to satisfy those like me, who like those kinds
   of things.
</p>
<p>
   On that note here's an art piece I finished recently. 
   It's inspired by the art of False Noise, Hyper Light Drifter, and
   Etiene Crauss. In 3 variants, because I couldn't decide on a 
   color palette.

    Thanks for reading my surface level thoughts on art. 
    And while these complexities are cool, I don't want to overthink them,
    so expect some more "simple" art.

   BTW my art and project files are licenced under CC0.
