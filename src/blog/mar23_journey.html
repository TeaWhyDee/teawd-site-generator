<p>
It's a fan artwork of travellers surfing on carpets (real lore) from 
the game Journey!
</p>
<p>
Now, this artwork is the most thought-out and the most
finished one I've ever really done, as I usually end up cutting 
the scope of an artwork a lot.
I felt both the most dissatisfied and the most happy about it.
The initial sketch is like, uh, 2 years old? Yeah.
I definitely was way too particular with how I drew it.
While working on it very sparringly, the finish line felt to
move further and further away until one evening I just sat
and decided to finish it - "Whatever I end up with is final".

    A lot of artistic choices I made here lead me to an 
    idea of making...

    ...The Cutout Thingy
</h4>
<p>
    Look at this! I made a layered paper cutout thing. Horribly
    jagged edges and very desaturated print, but it exists!
    I will say one thing only, and it is that making this one
    was very theraputic and enjoyable. Honestly I wanna do more
    IRL stuff.

    I had some other thoughts, but, maybe next time.
