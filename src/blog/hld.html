I first played Hyper Light Drifter 4 years ago, it quickly
became one of my favorite games. Recently, during some stressful times,
I decided to listen to it's soundtrack again. At the end, I cried.

   The game is set in a post-apocalyptic 
   world, where nature has overtaken most structures
   and the survivors have either gone mad and murderous
   or gone into hiding trying preserve what's little left of the old world.
   It hits every point for me: 
   great exploration, hard but fair challenge and combat,
   simple but fun mechanics, awe-inspiring art and animation. And
   of course its dialogue-less story.

    What really made this game so special for me though in its music
    and sound design. 
    Composed by the great Disasterpeace, the music stands on it's own 
    unlike anything I've ever heard. The uniqueness and
    the impressionistic style of it perfectly intertwines with 
    the cryptic and beautiful world of Hyper Light Drifter.

    The music captures the feeling of every space you encounter -
    be it vast underground catacombs or a calm forest growing on 
    the remains of giant war machines, the echoes of which you 
    can hear in the distance - transitioning
    seemlessly from one area to another. The game also knows 
    when to use silence, leaving you with the ambience of the area.

   Replaying the game I noticed so many new details, nearly every area 
   has some effect on the soundtrack, you can hear the crackling of 
   thousand year old trees and the slight buzz of ancient technologies.

    My favorite track is titled "Panacea", 
    the feelings it envokes in me is 
    unmatched by any other music-piece. It perfectly captured
    my melancholic mood. It let me cry out all of my frustrations 
    and I'm grateful for that.

   I don't like spoilers. And this post was as spoiler-free as I could get it.
   I didn't show any big encounters, any big reveals. But I hope you will look
   more into this game and listen to every little detail on your playthrough!
