    When all the physical and intellectual space around us seems to be already
    conquered or out of reach for a regular human, we turn to art, navigating
    it's fractal dimensions like the sailers of old discovering never before
    seen lands and species.
    But lets not fool ourselves, reaching something groundbreaking in art
    is like reaching for the stars, it's as difficult and as simple as
    cracking the formula of everything.

    Art is the new oil. There is a seemingly never-ending stream of it in
    everyones phone. It's being exploited and automated.
    One day we might have access to the universal generator of any picture,
    song or story imaginable, but before that day I will stretch my hand
    out into the ocean of ideas, in hopes of catching someithing new.
