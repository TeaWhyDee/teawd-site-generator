    For the first time in forever I could completely dedicate myself
    to game development for entire 3 days during the latest Ludum Dare.
</p>
<h3>
    Taking Risks
</h3>
<p>
    Me and PizzArt had very little experience making 3D games,
    so starting one was a pretty bold decision on our part.
    To save us from complete failure and to greatly simplify
    development, I decided to make a locked-camera top-down view.
    This was also our first time inviting a "stranger" to help us
    with sound-design and music. I believe this was a very important
    decision.

<h3>
    Designing the game
</h3>
<p>
    The theme for the game was "Every 10 seconds". It sucks.
    We couldn't think of any non-trivial mechanics so instead
    I decided to focus on art and story. For the character, I
    came up with the first cute thing that came to mind, a black
    yellow-eyed cat. The entirety of the first 2 days were
    spent designing assets and animating the characters.
    The only mechanic was enemies looking at you every 10 seconds,
    things felt really dire. I really wanted a more insteresting
    character, so by the end of day 2
    I came up with a genius idea of a constantly sneezing cat.
    It's both cute and ties together the idea of enemies only
    being able to see you every 10 seconds.
