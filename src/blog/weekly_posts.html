    Hello. I've decided that I need to make weekly posts.
    And not just weekly posts, I need to have meaningful
    weekly posts, about projects.
    I think this would motivate me to make plans and
    deliver on them. And to make sure that I don't
    skip a week, I will donate 1000 rubles for every
    week skipped to a charity of my choosing.
    <br>
    And well, since I just came up with this idea
    and didn't have a week to prepare, I will share
    some random abstract pixel art I made recently:

    <a href="/resources/art/work_day_pixel_art_pixel/work_day_pixel_art.png">
        <img id="medimg" src="/resources/art/work_day_pixel_art/work_day_pixel_art.png" alt="pixel art" />
    </a>

</p>

    charities.
