<p>
First of all, this blog post is about a somewhat specific problem. Despite
this, I think it is quite useful to most readers looking for some Linux
knowledge as the tools I used are very general. Let's start with the
explanation of
</p>
<h4>
   The problem 
</h4>
<p>
   Sometimes I have good ideas when I'm outside. Sometimes I really wanna
   preserve these ideas, but it's very inconvenient to use phone keyboards,
   especially on the move. One solution is recording my voice. But then, I
   would want to transfer those recordings to my computer for future reference.
   But what if I also want to read the text version of those voice recordings?
   Let's handle these problems one at a time.
</p>
<h4>
   Syncthing files
</h4>
<h5>
   Syncthing 
</h5>
<p>
<a href="https://syncthing.net/">
   Syncthing</a> is an open source cross-platform program that can sync folders
   accross multiple devices. It's perfect for this problem, as it allows for
   P2P syncing (for example from a phone to a computer).
   <br>
   It's very easy to set up aswell, you download it on both devices, open a
   browser (Synthing has a web frontend) tab on 127.0.0.1:8384 and scan the ID
   QR with your phones camera. Then share whatever is the folder that has your
   audio recordings.
</p>
<p>
    If your init system is systemd, to start synthing (and enable autostart
    at boot) you can run (where USER is your linux user):
</p><p>
    systemctl enable syncthing@USER.service --now
</p><p>
   Synthing has configuration options for encryption and file filtering.
   If you want more robust syncing, you could also host a Syncthing instance 
   on a server.
</p>
<h4>
   Speech to text 
</h4>
<p>
   To convert my speech to text I use the SpeechRecognition python package:
   </p><p>
      pip install SpeechRecognition 
   </p><p>
   It supports many speech recognition options, including offline ones.
   It's also really easy to use, check 
   <a href="https://github.com/TeaWhyDee/public-scripts/blob/master/phone_diary/recognize.py">
      my script</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Options (present in my script as comments):
    <ul>
        <li>
            Pocketsphinx (low-accuracy offline option): 
            </p><p>
                pip install pocketsphinx
            </p><p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Google translate (has a limit on length)
        </li>
        <li>
            Google cloud (free, requires registration) 
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
There are also other online and offline options.
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/">
    (SpeechRecognition documentation)</a>
</p>
<h4>
    Storing recorings in notes
</h4>
<h5>
   Vimwiki 
</h5>
<p>
    I use vimwiki 
    <a href="https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki">
       vimwiki</a> (a (neo)vim plugin) that makes managing markdown files in a
   wiki-like manner extremely easy. Vimwiki also has a diary option. To store
   the recording path and text in my notes, I wrote a few scripts.
</p>
<p>
    The speech-to-diary.sh script calls the speech recognition script 
    on a selected file, appends transcription to a vimwiki diary and 
    (optionally) moves the voice recording to the vimwiki folder.
    it has a bunch of flags, you can get a help message by running:
    </p><p>
       ./speech-to-diary.sh -h 
    </p><p>
</p>
<p>
    The text that it puts looks like this:
    </p><p>
        20220328_162342.m4a 16:24:05  <br>
        Whatever speech recognition returned <br>
        /home/tea/vimwiki/diary/resources/20220328_162342.wav
    </p><p>
    I have a vim shortcut that plays an audio file under the cursor so that
    I can also listen to it if the transcription is not accurate enough.
</p>
<p>
   If you don't use vim or vimwiki, you can just change the last 
   line of the script to save the text to a file of your choosing.
</p>
<h4>
   Tying it all together 
</h4>
<h5>
   Actual Linux knowledge 
</h5>
<p>
   Now, we need a way to react to new files appearing in the syncing 
   directory. For that, we can use the linux inotify interface, that 
   waits for changes in files. For syncthing, the following command
   works:
   </p><p>
       inotifywait -c -r -m -e attrib $PATH_TO_WATCH
   </p><p>
   You can also see it used in a script. Be sure to read the readme
   on the repo for some additional information on setting up
   a systemd service (if you don't know how).
</p>
<p>
   Now, if you autostart syncthing and the watchscript at system boot, it 
   will process all new audio files.

MPV is one of my favorite open source projects. It's a simple-looking 
video player with an enormous amount of features while also being 
highly extensible through the lua programming language.
</p>
<h4>
   MPV-splice Script 
</h4>
<p>
    MPV-splice is a script that allows you to use MPV as a video editor.
    You set the start and end timings for fragments, and then 
    the script cuts the video and concatenates the fragments.
</p>
<p>
   I made a fork of it to extend it's abilities.
   <ul>
       <li>
           I added an option to automatically upload
            the video (to any platform, but the default config works for Streamable).
       </li>
       <li>
           I added an option to reencode the video, making the timings frame perfect.
           By default, the script does not reencode the video, allowing for extremely 
           fast results.
       </li>
       <li>
           I fixed the editing of online videos. The script will only download the 
           selected portions of the video, which allows you to cut out fragments of even
           hours long YouTube videos for example.
       </li>
   </ul>
</p>
<p>
   Another useful script I forked is 8mb, which compresses your video to 8mb, changing
   it's FPS and resolution to appropriate values.

This blog-post is about my experience of playing music on Linux, although pretty much all
software I mention here works on Windows, Mac, Linux.. and even Android.
</p>
<h4>
   Browser as a Music Player 
</h4>
<p>
   The most basic way to play music is using some website.
   Most people prefer Spotify, but I personally hate it's interface 
   almost as much as I hate subscription services.
</p>
<p>
   For the longest time I've been using 
   <em class="orange">
       Soundcloud</em>, it has most music I like, 
   especially the quirky electronic type, all for free.
    It also allows you to upload songs without 
    any additional setup. But,
   of course, there are songs that are not on there. 
   The worst part is that some more main-stream artists
   have their songs region-locked or only available with
   soundcloud premium.
</p>
<h4>
   Local Music Library 
</h4>
<p>
   A year back I decided to begin storing my music locally.
   This approach ensures that I have access to all my
   favorite music, in best quality, offline, forever.
</p>
<p>
   It is honestly really freeing and opened a bunch of 
   possibilities for me.
</p>
<h5>
   DeaDBeeF Music Player 
</h5>
<p>
   I first settled on DeaDBeeF, as it's highly customisable,
   extensible and actively developed.
</p>
<p>
   Configuring takes some time to get used to. 
   You have to enable 'design mode' in the 'View' submenu to 
   start adding and removing panes. It allows you to use a lot of 
   GTK3 (UI library) widgets to structure your window 
   however you like. 
   <a href="/resources/music_playing/deadbeef_screenshot.png">
       <img src="/resources/music_playing/deadbeef_screenshot.png" alt=""/>
   </a>
   You can find my config in the GitHub repo linked below. 
</p>
<p>
    I especially like the visualization plugins that I found.
    On Arch-based systems it is extremely easy to install plugins:
    </p><p>
        yay -S deadbeef-plugin-spectrogram-gtk3-git \ <br>
        deadbeef-plugin-musical-spectrum-gtk3-git \ <br>
        deadbeef-plugin-rating \ <br>
        deadbeef-plugin-waveform-gtk3-git <br>
    </p><p>
    Some plugins are configured through settings, others through
    the right-click menu.
</p>
<p>
   There are 2 main problems with DeaDBeeF for me:
</p>
   <ul>
       <li>
           Lack of dynamic playlists or being able to go though
            artsts/albums without creating playlists for them manually.
        </li>
        <li>
            No playback queue display (it only shows the song position
            in the queue next to it).
        </li>
   </ul>
<p>
   Both of these features are in plans so at some point in the future
   I hope we'll get them.
</p>
<h5>
   MPD Music Server
</h5>
<p>
   Recently I started using 
   <a href="https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/MPD">
      MPD</a>. It is even more technical than
   DeaDBeeF. It allows you to connect to it through a socket.
</p>
<p>
   All of it might sound scary but all you need to do to set it up 
   is create 1 config file. There are a lot of clients that 
   allow you to connect to an MPD server with relatively conventional
   interfaces. I am currently using 
   <a href="https://github.com/cdrummond/cantata">
      Cantata</a>, as it's the most feature rich one I could find.
</p>
<p>
   The great thing about MPD is that you can connect as many clients 
   as you want and they all will be synchronized with each other.
   There are clients for scrobbling your music to 
   <a href="https://last.fm">
      last.fm</a> (with <em>mpdas</em>),
  setting your discord 'rich presense' and controlling 
  playback with media keys or a notification (with <em>mpdris2</em>).
  It's the most modular music playing experience and I love it.
  My config looks like this:
 </p><p>
     music_directory    "~/Music" <br>
     db_file            "~/.config/mpd/database" <br>
     playlist_directory "~/.config/mpd/playlists" <br>
     sticker_file       "~/.config/mpd/sticker.sql" <br>
     log_file           "syslog" <br>
     auto_update "yes" <br>
     restore_paused "yes" <br>
<br>
     audio_output { <br>
     type    "pulse" <br>
     name    "pulse audio" <br>
     } <br>
<br>
audio_output { <br>
     type    "fifo" <br>
     name    "my_fifo" <br>
     path    "/tmp/mpd.fifo" <br>
     format  "22050:16:2" <br>
     } <br>
 </p><p> 
 'sticker_file' allows for custom music ratings (supported by Cantata),
 'fifo' audio output allows for latency-less audio
 visualization with 
 <a href="https://github.com/jarcode-foss/glava">
    Glava</a>.
    </p>
<p>
    To install everything I mentioned on Arch you would run: 
    </p><p>
        yay -S mpd mpd-discord-rpc-git mpdas mpdris2 cantata 
    </p><p>
</p>

<h4>
   Remote Music Library 
</h4>
<p>
   But what if I want to play my music on a device where 
   I don't have my audio library?
</p>
<h5>
   MPD Does it All 
</h5>
<p>
   You can create an http output by putting the following lines
   in your config:
   </p><p>
       audio_output { <br>
       type        "httpd" <br>
       name        "My HTTP Stream" <br>
       encoder        "lame" <br>
       port        "8000" <br>
       bitrate        "192" <br>
       format        "44100:16:1" <br>
       max_clients    "0" # 0=no limit <br>
       }  <br>
   </p><p>
   I host an MPD instance on my server and can control playback with 
   any client. On my phone I use
   <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.namelessdev.mpdroid/">
      MPDroid</a> (which can also stream the aduio).
    To stream audio on desktop you have to connect to the specified port
    through a music player that can play http streams, like mpv,
    or a web browser. 
    MPD clients, such as Cantata, can also play http audio streams.  
    The delay is a little annoying. There is a setup that allows for 0 delay
    playback ( with local mpd using a remote music library) I saw here:
    <a href="https://www.joram.io/blog/android-streaming-mpd/">
       www.joram.io/blog/android-streaming-mpd/</a>
</p>
<h4>
   But I want my recommendations!
</h4>
<h5>
   MPD :) 
</h5>
<p>
There is a 
<a href="https://github.com/saelz/mpd-auto-queue">
    client</a>
that automatically queues new songs based on
last.fm recommendations.
