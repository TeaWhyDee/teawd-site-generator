This blog-post is about my experience of playing music on Linux, although pretty much all
software I mention here works on Windows, Mac, Linux.. and even Android.
</p>
<h4>
   Browser as a Music Player 
</h4>
<p>
   The most basic way to play music is using some website.
   Most people prefer Spotify, but I personally hate it's interface 
   almost as much as I hate subscription services.
</p>
<p>
   For the longest time I've been using 
   <em class="orange">
       Soundcloud</em>, it has most music I like, 
   especially the quirky electronic type, all for free.
    It also allows you to upload songs without 
    any additional setup. But,
   of course, there are songs that are not on there. 
   The worst part is that some more main-stream artists
   have their songs region-locked or only available with
   soundcloud premium.
</p>
<h4>
   Local Music Library 
</h4>
<p>
   A year back I decided to begin storing my music locally.
   This approach ensures that I have access to all my
   favorite music, in best quality, offline, forever.
</p>
<p>
   It is honestly really freeing and opened a bunch of 
   possibilities for me.
</p>
<h5>
   DeaDBeeF Music Player 
</h5>
<p>
   I first settled on DeaDBeeF, as it's highly customisable,
   extensible and actively developed.
</p>
<p>
   Configuring takes some time to get used to. 
   You have to enable 'design mode' in the 'View' submenu to 
   start adding and removing panes. It allows you to use a lot of 
   GTK3 (UI library) widgets to structure your window 
   however you like. 
   <a href="/resources/music_playing/deadbeef_screenshot.png">
       <img src="/resources/music_playing/deadbeef_screenshot.png" alt=""/>
   </a>
   You can find my config in the GitHub repo linked below. 
</p>
<p>
    I especially like the visualization plugins that I found.
    On Arch-based systems it is extremely easy to install plugins:
    <code>
        yay -S deadbeef-plugin-spectrogram-gtk3-git \ <br>
        deadbeef-plugin-musical-spectrum-gtk3-git \ <br>
        deadbeef-plugin-rating \ <br>
        deadbeef-plugin-waveform-gtk3-git <br>
    </code>
    Some plugins are configured through settings, others through
    the right-click menu.
</p>
<p>
   There are 2 main problems with DeaDBeeF for me:
</p>
   <ul>
       <li>
           Lack of dynamic playlists or being able to go though
            artsts/albums without creating playlists for them manually.
        </li>
        <li>
            No playback queue display (it only shows the song position
            in the queue next to it).
        </li>
   </ul>
<p>
   Both of these features are in plans so at some point in the future
   I hope we'll get them.
</p>
<h5>
   MPD Music Server
</h5>
<p>
   Recently I started using 
   <a href="https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/MPD">
      MPD</a>. It is even more technical than
   DeaDBeeF. It allows you to connect to it through a socket.
</p>
<p>
   All of it might sound scary but all you need to do to set it up 
   is create 1 config file. There are a lot of clients that 
   allow you to connect to an MPD server with relatively conventional
   interfaces. I am currently using 
   <a href="https://github.com/cdrummond/cantata">
      Cantata</a>, as it's the most feature rich one I could find.
</p>
<p>
   The great thing about MPD is that you can connect as many clients 
   as you want and they all will be synchronized with each other.
   There are clients for scrobbling your music to 
   <a href="https://last.fm">
      last.fm</a> (with <em>mpdas</em>),
  setting your discord 'rich presense' and controlling 
  playback with media keys or a notification (with <em>mpdris2</em>).
  It's the most modular music playing experience and I love it.
  My config looks like this:
 <code>
     music_directory    "~/Music" <br>
     db_file            "~/.config/mpd/database" <br>
     playlist_directory "~/.config/mpd/playlists" <br>
     sticker_file       "~/.config/mpd/sticker.sql" <br>
     log_file           "syslog" <br>
     auto_update "yes" <br>
     restore_paused "yes" <br>
<br>
     audio_output { <br>
     type    "pulse" <br>
     name    "pulse audio" <br>
     } <br>
<br>
audio_output { <br>
     type    "fifo" <br>
     name    "my_fifo" <br>
     path    "/tmp/mpd.fifo" <br>
     format  "22050:16:2" <br>
     } <br>
 </code> 
 'sticker_file' allows for custom music ratings (supported by Cantata),
 'fifo' audio output allows for latency-less audio
 visualization with 
 <a href="https://github.com/jarcode-foss/glava">
    Glava</a>.
    </p>
<p>
    To install everything I mentioned on Arch you would run: 
    <code>
        yay -S mpd mpd-discord-rpc-git mpdas mpdris2 cantata 
    </code>
</p>

<h4>
   Remote Music Library 
</h4>
<p>
   But what if I want to play my music on a device where 
   I don't have my audio library?
</p>
<h5>
   MPD Does it All 
</h5>
<p>
   You can create an http output by putting the following lines
   in your config:
   <code>
       audio_output { <br>
       type        "httpd" <br>
       name        "My HTTP Stream" <br>
       encoder        "lame" <br>
       port        "8000" <br>
       bitrate        "192" <br>
       format        "44100:16:1" <br>
       max_clients    "0" # 0=no limit <br>
       }  <br>
   </code>
   I host an MPD instance on my server and can control playback with 
   any client. On my phone I use
   <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.namelessdev.mpdroid/">
      MPDroid</a> (which can also actually stream the aduio).
    To stream audio on desktop you have to connect to the specified port
    through a music player that can play http streams, like mpv. 
    MPD clients, can also play http streams.
    Browsers will also work, as MPD outputs audio through the 
    http protocol. The delay is a little annoying. There is a 
    setup that allows for 0 delay playback (
    with local mpd using a remote music library
    ) I saw on this blog:
    <a href="https://www.joram.io/blog/android-streaming-mpd/">
       www.joram.io/blog/android-streaming-mpd/</a>
</p>
<h4>
   But I want my auto-queue!
</h4>
<h5>
   MPD :) 
</h5>
<p>
There is a 
<a href="https://github.com/saelz/mpd-auto-queue">
    client</a>
that automatically queues new songs based on
last.fm recommendations.
