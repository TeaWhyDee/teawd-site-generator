<p>
Incomprehensible and unstructured jumble of code scattered 
across a range of highly specific tools that is one 
typo away from crumbling into ruins.
This is how I would describe
</p>
<h4>
   My static-site generator
</h4>
<p>
    To write a new article, I go to my blog-post directory,
    open a new file with vim and use a snippet (powered by 
    <a href="https://github.com/sirver/UltiSnips">
       UltiSnips</a>)
    that inputs an html template with todays date, it 
    also uses some python to automatically set ids 
    to article titles. <br>
    After that I am free to use any html I please inside 
    the article body. When I'm done, I set a flag 
    (an html comment) to indicate to my site generator
    that the article should be published/updated/deleted.
</p>
<p>
    Yep, it's all plaintext. I don't know what will happen
    if I mess up any of it.
    <br>
    This is how I roll.
</p>
<p>
    The site-generator itself is written in python and 
    just parses the file for the 
    fields I mentioned and then compiles all blog-posts 
    into html pages. It's NOT recommended for use yet but 
    you can 
    <a href="https://github.com/TeaWhyDee/teawd-site-generator">
       check it out</a>.
    What I would recommend is Luke Smith's 
    <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb">
       lb</a>.
</p>
<h4>
   So what's new? 
</h4>
<p>
    New and fresh additions to the site:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Posts are now tagged and
        each tag has it's own page.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each blog-post now has an id, try clicking on
        the title of a post to get a link directly
        to it!
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    I also rewrote a lot of the code to make future 
    changes easier. <br>
</p>
<h4>
   What's in plans?
</h4>
<p>
    I didn't have enough time to implement everything,
    in the future you can expect:
    <ul>
        <li>
            RSS feeds.
        </li>
        <li>
            An index page and a separate page for each post.
        </li>
        <li>
            Better explanation of the inner workings
            and a more general implementation.
        </li>
    </ul>
