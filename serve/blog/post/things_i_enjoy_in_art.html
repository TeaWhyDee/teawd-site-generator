I might be stating the obvious, but I don't think there is any objective value
to an art piece, except, maybe, it's historical value.
<br>
What I wanna talk about, is what makes an art pirece feel more valuable to me.
Well, one obvious thing is the context. A lot of my favorite music and visual
artwork comes from games and movies I really like. I think it could be
thought of as personal historical value, it makes you remember the story and
its characters.
</p>
<h4>
   Layers
</h4>
<p>
   Good art is like onions, it has layers.
</p>
<h5>
   Details 
</h5>
<p>
   One way to achieve this, is to have details or shapes that are not obvious 
   on first viewing. A great example is this Hyper Light Drifter artwork
   I have as a poster. 
<a href="https://www.fangamer.com/products/hld-poster-fallen">
<img src="/resources/HLD/poster.png" id="smallimg"
alt="https://www.fangamer.com/products/hld-poster-fallen"/>
</a>
   One of the details is the hand and a skull of a giant that form the rock.
   Some other details require familiarity wuth the game to notice. Discovering
   these was very satisfying.
</p>
<h5>
   Metaphors 
</h5>
<p>
   A lot of art also tries to convey some idea or commentary. Sometimes it's
   explicit, sometimes hidden in metaphors and puzzles. Unfortunately,
   I'm not the best at deciphering metaphors, and even worse at trying to
   come up with a metaphor that could convey some of my feelings or ideas.
   I love when an artpiece leaves a lot to interpretation, a great example
   I can think of is 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/vewnscape/videos">vewns animations</a>: 
   surface level topics and ideas are 
   clear, others require multiple watches and some thinking to understand,
   but still leave some ambiguity.
</p>
<h5>
   Hidden Messages 
</h5>
<p>
   What I recently came to like to do is putting ARG-like hidden messages in
   some of the art I make. 
   It's mostly to satisfy those like me, who like those kinds
   of things.
</p>
<p>
   On that note here's an art-piece I finished recently. 
   It's inspired by the art of False Noise, Hyper Light Drifter, and
   Etiene Crauss. In 3 variants, because I couldn't decide on a 
   color palette.
